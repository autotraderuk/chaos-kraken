An application that can be used to simulate JVM based failure scenarios when running on a delivery platform.

 Terrorise the Shipp'ng lanes with the Chaos Kraken, an incomplete FAAS (Failures as a Service).

The first version of Chaos Kraken was created at https://careers.autotrader.co.uk/[Auto Trader UK] back in 2017. It was
originally built to test various application failure conditions on their private cloud infrastructure.

As Auto Trader started their migration to public cloud and Kubernetes, the Chaos Kraken evolved to cater for more
failure modes.

Chaos Kraken is actively used within Auto Trader to verify various behaviours of their
https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine[GKE] based delivery platform.

== Getting Started

A https://github.com/autotraderuk/chaos-kraken/packages/143034[GitHub package] containing the executable JAR for Chaos
Kraken is created every time a version is released using a
https://github.com/autotraderuk/chaos-kraken/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Publish+release%22[GitHub Actions workflow].

The application JAR can be downloaded from here, or you can clone the repo and build it yourself.

=== Building

Chaos Kraken uses https://gradle.org/[Gradle] for dependency management and other build time concerns. It also uses the
https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html[Gradle Wrapper] allowing you to simply clone the repo and
build the project with minimal effort.

....
./gradlew build
....

This will create an executable Spring Boot JAR providing all the features of the Chaos Kraken, as well as these docs
hosted at `/docs/index.html`.

=== Running

Once you've downloaded or built the application JAR simply run it, for example:

....
java -jar chaos-kraken-0.1.2.jar
....

By default, the application will then be available on port `8080`.

You can verify this from your terminal:

include::{snippets}/welcome/curl-request.adoc[]

Which will give you the following response:

== Simulating behaviours

Chaos Kraken provides a variety of behaviours that simulate ways in which an application may behave badly, or even fail,
whilst running on a delivery platform.

=== killapp

The `killapp` behaviour simulates the JVM process dying by exiting the process.
